										<h1>My Music Gallery</h1>
									</header>
									<p>I have been a loyal fan of American pop music for over a decade, since I was a child who barely knew anything about the world. In these golden years of life, it was music that shaped my values, told me to be myself, and motivated me to explore about life and love relentlessly.</p>
									<p>In my teenage years, I was fortunate enough to have lived in a blossom time of pop music, thanks to the pop stars around 2010. Since then, I have been expanding my boundaries in music appreciation. Now I listen to all genres of music, from pop to indie rock, hip-hop and R&B.</p>
									<p>Below are albums crucial to my aesthetic values and personal style. Don't hesitate to DM me on Instagram if I am lucky enough to share some common interests with you!</p>

									<h2>Norman F---ing Rockwell - Lana Del Rey </h2>
									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/NFR.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400"/></a>
									<p></p>
									<p>Lana Del Rey has been one of my favorite female songwriters since her debut in 2012. Different from her previous works that relied heavily on fancy production, retro Americanism stereotypes, and her intricate (also dramatic) vocal performance, Norman F---ing Rockewell returns to the most fundamental element of music - poetic songwriting. Collaborating with the gold star producer, Jack Antonoff, Lana successfully integrates beautiful melodies, California visuals, and political reflections, enticing her listeners to enjoy the moment with the California sunshine, ocean wave and palm trees, despite such a disruptive time of human history. </p>

									<h2>Ctrl - SZA</h2>
									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/ctrl.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400"/></a>
									<p></p>
									<p>Getting to know SZA from the famous Rihanna collab, 'Consideration', off of the 8th album from the Fenty Beauty giant, I immediately found her the herald of my own heart - she sings what I think. Though SZA is all about the struggle of being a 'normal girl' and I share a different biological gender than her, the confusion and pain in self-identificication are universal to all human beings. She is outspoken about falling in love with men she shouldn't, dying to be the kind of girl that her man'd be proud to take home to Mama, pondering another life if she was meant to be a girl no different from the most ordinary ones. Everything that SZA puts out is about the inevitable puzzles thorughout everyone's personal growth, if they choose to experience that upsetting but meaningful process.</p>

									<h2>DAMN - Kendrick Lamar</h2>
									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/damn.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400"/></a>
                                    <p></p>
									<p>Who doesn't like this Hip-hop masterpiece? Not like K Dot's previous albums, To Pimp A Butterfly and good kid m.A.A.d city, DAMN is groomed to be more pop music formatted, radio-friendly, and accomodating to general listeners (like me). However, Lamar doesn't lose his power in attitude expression, political engagement, narrative telling, and artistic image establishment. In the iconic 8-minute self-revealing epic track, 'FEAR', Lamar opens up about his contemplations on his success, and his worries about losing that success overnight - a kind of introspection not common in Hip-hop songs. If SZA's Ctrl is about a girl striving to acknowledge herself towards the harsheness of adulthood, the Lamar's DAMN is a statement from a successful and mature man, whose only concerns revolve around self-constraint, but with no limits in discussing things that really matter to the world - violence, gun control, racism, etc. </p>

									<h2>reputation - Taylor Swift</h2>
									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/rep.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400"/></a>
									<p></p>
									<p>Most controversial opinion: reputation is Taylor Swift's best album, period. I know that many people can't accept the acute image change from a Nashville country girl/New York City modern barbie to a revenging witch, wrestling with heavy bass, violent drums and provocative vocals. Personally, I prefer music with dynamic rhythms that I can sway to, and that's probably why I like the first half of the reputation album very much. After the interclude track, 'So It Goes', the old Taylor is back (from death). Classic love songs with R&B and ballad elements, romanticizing finding the lover of her life while disregarding her reputation as a late American sweetheart.</p>
                                    <p>When it comes to Taylor Swift, we can't circumvent the discussion about her artistic image, partly because of her team who do an excellent job in marketing and brand-establishment. The old Taylor image is so perfect, that any minor controversy around her would be incessantly amplified and make her seem like a fake hypocrite & victim player. In reputation, it can be observed that Taylor Swift is intending to get rid of that image, which was an asset to the country girl before, but is a burden to a high-profile female pop icon right now. It's always easier being a bad girl than a good girl, and Miss Swift seems to have known this straight fact better than anyone else.</p>

									<h2>Jaime - Brittany Howard</h2>
									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/jaime.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400"/></a>
									<p></p>
									<p>Partly as a salute to her late sister who died of a rare cancer and who taught Brittany to sing, Jaime is a complete anthem to love, sexual awakening, self identity, spirit and experiments. I love it when Brittany sings about the flushing face when falling love with another girl under the late night sky of Georgia, the pride she takes in the man she loves for 'not judging her', as well as her being outspoken about her 'ugly past' while growing from a marginalized home community. Whenever I feel hopeless about life, I'd listen to his powerful album - listen to Brittany assuring me, 'and that cause is to spread the enlightenment of love, compassion, and humanity to those who are not touched by its light.'</p>

									<h2>Masseduction - St. Vincent</h2>
									<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/masseduction.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400"/></a>
									<p></p>
									<p>I'm Annie Clark's biggest fan. Everything from her edgy appearance, powerlessness when speaking and jokes on Instagram, makes her my role model. I believe that most people get to know her by the famous ballad 'New York' and I'm no exception. But after streaming the whole album 'Masseduction', I was impressed by how expressive this woman is, beyond the boundary of thinking about 'the only mother-- in the city who can stand her'. She explores the love of fluid sexuality, criticizes the morbid madness for immortal youth by playing the paronomasia of 'Los Ageless', warns about the unnoticed penetration of drug into people's daily lives... Although Annie herself couldn't even illustrate what she had intended to express in this album (from an interview by Pitchfork), but sometimes isn't it interesting to interpret an artist's mind based on fragments? </p>
