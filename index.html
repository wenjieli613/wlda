											<h3>University of Rochester</h3>
											<p>I was lucky to have been admitted to Simon Business School, University of Rochester in April 2019, a total surprise as I was wrapping up my senior undergrad year. I have been having huge fun here at Rochester, getting exposed to a great variety of cutting-edge data analytics skills, interacting with my amazing peers, and dreaming about every version of future that I can possibly think of.</p>

											<h3>Nanjing Audit University</h3>
											<p>My university is in the capital of six dynasties - Nanjing City, which is also the capital of my home province. I spent most of my undergrad years working with my international accounting certificate, taking part in debate competitions, and exploring the beautiful city with my friends. My happy day consisted of: spending the whole Sunday morning doing schoolwork in the library, taking the subway downtown for shopping, movies and Japanese food, and coming back to the school dorm in late night. Those were days when I was young!</p>

											<h3>Rugao, Jiangsu</h3>
											<p>I take pride in coming from a small town! My hometown, Rugao, right in proximity with Shanghai, is famous worldwide for the longevity of residents and a history of 6000 years. A lot of historical spots are well preserved even today, including parks originating from the Ming Dynasty and temples attracting millions of Buddhists each year. Life at my hometown is easy and comfy: people enjoy the charasteristic 'breakfast & tea', mini lobsters in the summertime and all kinds of traditional Chinese desserts in winter; they connect closely with family and friends, playing poker, enjoying dinners and walking around the city river whenever they got time. I'll definitely go back to my hometown when I get old and have enough money to live a leisure life on!</p>
